# Source Directory: src/mbgrd2gltf/

This directory contains the source files for the program mbgrd2gltf, a 2D/3D grd to gltf conversion program.
The original gltf-generator program was created for STOQS by a CSUMB Capstone team in Fall 2021. This program was contributed to MB-System as part of the CSUMB Capstone in Spring 2023. Additional refinements and additions added as part of CSUMB Capstone in Spring 2024 (draco compression) and Fall 2025 (code refinement).

# Georeference and provenance metadata

The glTF file records where the model is and how it was made in `asset.extras`, in the blocks `georeference` (coordinate reference system `EPSG:4978`, absolute or relative-to-center vertices, the `center` = GeoOrigin as ECEF meters, the same point as `geodeticCenter`, the `heightReference` and the `extent`), `provenance` (linked to W3C PROV-O through a JSON-LD `@context`: software and version, time of execution, command line, working directory, user, host and the input grid) and `MB-System` (grid size, spacing and registration, vertical exaggeration, Draco quantization and the vertical reference). The `--html` page holds the same tree in X3D `GeoMetadata` and `WorldInfo` nodes. The code is in `provenance.h` and `provenance.cpp` and is tested by `tests/test_provenance.cpp`. The names are shared with `mbmesh` and are described in [../mbmesh/GEOREFERENCE.md](../mbmesh/GEOREFERENCE.md). The grid value is used as a height above the WGS 84 ellipsoid, with no geoid correction.

# Viewpoints in the --html page

The page has two overview viewpoints for the same view, looking straight down from above the middle of the grid with north at the top: `OVERVIEW_LOCAL`, a plain `Viewpoint` in the coordinates of the model (ECEF minus the GeoOrigin's ECEF position), which is bound when the page opens, and `OVERVIEW_GEO`, a `GeoViewpoint` that refers to the GeoOrigin. Choose between them in the Viewpoint menu, or step through them with Page Down. The GeoOrigin is written as a child node of the `GeoViewpoint`, because `geoOrigin` is an SFNode field and X3DOM takes it from a child element: it ignores an attribute naming a DEF, and then places the `GeoViewpoint` in absolute ECEF, millions of meters from a model that is relative to the GeoOrigin. Both viewpoints are written so that each can be checked against the other. A GeoViewpoint of your own can be added with `--geoviewpoint=lon,lat,elev,clon,clat,celev` (the camera position and the point it looks at) or `--geoviewpoint=lon,lat,elev,ax,ay,az,angle,clon,clat,celev` (with the orientation as an axis and an angle, as a `GeoViewpoint` takes it, so that no rotation looks level to the north and `1 0 0 -1.5708` looks straight down), which can be repeated and gives `USER_GEOVIEW_1`, `USER_GEOVIEW_2` and so on, written as readable `GeoViewpoint` nodes with the position as latitude, longitude and elevation and the GeoOrigin used again (`<GeoOrigin USE='GRID_ORIGIN'>`). The values are geodetic, in the order of `--geoorigin` (longitude first; the node has latitude first, as X3D does), so they do not depend on the GeoOrigin or the data. The **Copy GeoViewpoint** button of the page puts the option for the view on the screen on the clipboard (the ten-number form) and in the X3DOM log; paste it into the command line of the next run.

# Code Formatting

* This directory uses its own .clang-format file to maintain a consistent coding style for the mbgrd2gltf program.
* To apply the formatting rules to this code, run the following script from within this directory:
	* ./clang-format.sh
* It is recommended to run before committing changes to keep the codebase consistent for future contributors.
