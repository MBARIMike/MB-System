// Draco compression of triangle meshes for the KHR_draco_mesh_compression extension of glTF, shared by mbmesh and mbgrd2gltf so
// that both choose the quantization the same way, write the same primitives and are given the same options:
//
//   --no-draco              write the arrays, without compression (the default is to compress)
//   --draco-precision NUM   the coarsest step of the quantization of the positions, in meters (default 0.001)
//   --draco-normal-bits NUM the bits of each component of a normal, 2 to 30 (default 10), for the programs that write normals
//
// The positions are quantized over the largest of the ranges of the three axes of each mesh, with the number of bits that makes
// the step no coarser than the precision, so a small mesh gets few bits and a large one more, not a fixed number.
//
// The code is the Draco source in src/mbdraco/draco, which both the CMake and the autotools builds compile. A build that does not
// include it (MBDRACO_WITH_DRACO not defined) has available() false, and the programs write meshes without compression.
