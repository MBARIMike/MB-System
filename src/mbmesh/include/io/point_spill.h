/*******************************************************************************
 * Soundings on disk, for surveys that are too large to hold in memory.
 *
 * Two files are involved. The reader writes each accepted sounding to a spill
 * file as it is read (PointSpill), so that memory does not grow with the number
 * of soundings. Once the reconstruction frame, the point spacing and the chunk
 * size are known, the points are read back in pieces and sorted into one file
 * per reconstruction chunk (ChunkBins), each chunk file holding the points of the
 * chunk and of the halo around it, so that a chunk is reconstructed from its own
 * file and only the chunks being worked on are in memory.
 *
 * The files are temporary and private to one run, in the host byte order. A chunk
 * file record is the bytes of a CollectedPoint (two Vec3 of doubles, 48 bytes).
 * A spill file record is smaller, 28 bytes: the position of the sounding as
 * three doubles and the number of its ping, since the sensor position is the
 * same for all the soundings of a ping and is kept once, in the track.
