/*******************************************************************************
 * Reconstruction of a surface mesh from a set of collected points, and a
 * chunked driver that reconstructs a large survey chunk by chunk.
 *
 * Chunking bounds memory and run time. The screened-Poisson grid covers the
 * bounding box of its input, so a single run over a whole survey needs a grid
 * that is mostly empty, and its cost grows quickly with size. Here the survey
 * is split into square horizontal chunks on a fixed lattice anchored at the
 * local-frame origin. Each chunk is reconstructed from its own points plus a
 * halo of neighboring points, and keeps only the triangles it owns.
