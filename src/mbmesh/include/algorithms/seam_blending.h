/*******************************************************************************
 * Chunks that agree where they meet.
 *
 * The screened Poisson fields of two neighboring chunks are solved apart, from
 * their own points, and differ where the chunks meet: by an additive offset
 * (each field is shifted so that its own samples sit on the iso-value) and by
 * the shape of the solution. The two surfaces then have a step between them
 * and the triangles that each keeps do not share vertices, so the seam shows.
 *
 * The grids of all the chunks have their nodes on one lattice, and a chunk's
 * edges are on lattice planes. If two chunks have the same field values on the
 * nodes of the plane they share, marching cubes makes the same vertices along
 * it, so the two meshes meet exactly, with no step and no gap.
 *
 * So a chunk takes the final field of the chunks that were finished before it
 * (the one to its west and the one to its south) on the planes it shares with
 * them, and adds to its own field a correction that is the difference there and
 * dies away smoothly, over a width, into the chunk. The field of the chunk is
 * left alone farther from the planes than that. The chunk then publishes its
 * own final field on its east and north planes, for the chunks that follow it.
